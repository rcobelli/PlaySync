Common streaming apps like ESPN & Fox Sports will allow you to do a multi-view (i.e. watch multiple streams at once) within their own app. However, there is no easy way to do this between apps on the Apple TV.

## Steps
1. Install & run https://github.com/m0ngr31/EPlusTV/tree/master on your local network
2. Run & install this repo on your AppleTV
3. Mix & match streams from ESPN, Fox & CBS

## Usage
1. Refresh the stream list
2. Select 4 from the list (the counter in the top right shows how many you have selected)
3. Press the playback button at the top
4. Gesture-swipe around to select which stream you want audio for
5. Tap to go full screen
6. `Menu` to go back to quad
7. `Menu` to go back to selection screen
